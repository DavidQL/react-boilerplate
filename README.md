### React Boilerplate
A simple boilerplate app that sets up React, Browserify, SCSS, and more for you.

#### Installation

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the server: `grunt develop`
3. Navigate to the specified URL an start developing.

#### Usage

There is only one command. Running `grunt develop` will compile your assets, start your server, and watch your directory for changes. If it encounters a change in `/js` or `/sass` it will re-compile assets.

#### Code entry point

You probably want to start writing code in `/js/skeleton.js`. That file comprises the main layout of the app. From there you can create your application by building out components.
